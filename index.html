</div>
		<div>Roadtrip</div>
		<div>The</div>
		<div>…when we arrived… we stopped
at a rest station to get
supplies before checking
in to our cabin</div>
		<div>…. there’s a forgotten town in
Tennesse we both wanted to see...
</div>
		<div>My friend Brendan and I
decided to go on a road trip...</div>
		<div>Look Around</div>
		<div>Look Inside</div>
		<div>…this is the only gas station for miles…</div>
		<div>Look Inside</div>
		<div>Yes! I’m hungry,
better leave some
change to pay</div>
		<div>Take Treat</div>
		<div>There’s a dust mark
on the counter,
somebody took
something from here...</div>
		<div>…eew… what happened?</div>
		<div>…well we definitely
won’t be getting gas
from here...</div>
		<div>Odd, something was here
for a long time
and it left a
mark on the counter</div>
		<div>I’d rather not…
better get back
to Brendan</div>
		<div>Oh? What’s this?</div>
		<div>Leave Treat</div>
		<div>Leave Treat</div>
		<div>This place is so old!
What is that stuff?</div>
		<div>Continue >></div>
		<div>Is… Is that blood?</div>
		<div>That car is rusted…
no way anyone’s driven
it in decades.
So muchh for gas...</div>
		<div>Continue >></div>
		<div>…so this is the cabin...</div>
		<div>it looks relatively normal...</div>
		<div>…we set our bags
down and take
a look around...</div>
		<div>Look Around On Your Own</div>
		<div>…what disaster are
they talking about?</div>
		<div>Go After Him</div>
		<div>…interesting...</div>
		<div>Brendan’s yelling upstairs!</div>
		<div>...Brendan disappeared...</div>
		<div>Look Around On Your Own</div>
		<div>That’s a drop! Brendan must
be over here...</div>
		<div>Whoof!</div>
		<div>Brendan?</div>
		<div>Nope!</div>
		<div>Yikes!</div>
		<div>I’m running so fast that I don’tsee the hole in the floor...</div>
		<div>…that piece of
paper on the floor
is right in front
of the door...</div>
		<div>Continue>></div>
		<div>Ahh!</div>
		<div>And I don’t like it but...</div>
		<div>I think I just
saw something...</div>
		<div>I don’t like it down here...</div>
		<div>Continue>></div>
		<div>Fine… anywhere but here...</div>
		<div>This place gives
me the creeps!</div>
		<div>Where did you come from!?</div>
		<div>really? I found
a really cool place,
we can walk there</div>
		<div>Geez… I need to
get out of here...</div>
		<div>I just went looking around...</div>
		<div>The walk calms
us both down. The fresh
air and wild grass
clears the stress away</div>
		<div>There’s a school around
here, isn’t there?
I think there'll
be answers there...</div>
		<div>Look, something strange is 
going on and I'm going to
check it out. The
newspaper and the photo...</div>
		<div>...I saw a spider
</div>
		<div>Why did you scream?
</div>
		<div>okay?</div>
		<div>...yeah… this’ll be the one...</div>
		<div>Look Around</div>
		<div>What did you do
to Brendan?
Where did you
take him?</div>
		<div>B-Brendan?</div>
		<div>Retrieve a token 
to release us
and your
friend will be fine</div>
		<div>I don’t know
if I’m feeling
anxiety or
curiosity...</div>
		<div>how?</div>
		<div>Either way
I’ve got to get
away from the voices
coming from the trees...</div>
		<div>Okay…
why do I get the
feeling somebody’s
watching me?</div>
		<div>follow the girls
and bring back
the token</div>
		<div>Just… no...</div>
		<div>…don’t do it…</div>
		<div>Retrieve a token
to set us free
and your friend
will be fine</div>
		<div>What is this?</div>
		<div>hmmughmm</div>
		<div>Fifty-two…twenty-five...</div>
		<div>The energy here is unreal...</div>
		<div>they will take you</div>
		<div>…cathedral...
</div>
		<div>No! Stop that!</div>
		<div>I guess I should
try saying some
of these things
on the walls</div>
		<div>…I see you...</div>
		<div>What do you want?</div>
		<div>the ghosts take
the lead into
the forest</div>
		<div>the sudden night
came when the ghosts
appeared and it’s
stayed since</div>
		<div>this must be the place…
but where do I find tokens?</div>
		<div>we come upon
a clearing and I
look down</div>
		<div>I don’t know where
we’re going, but the ghosts
lead me to a spot in
the forest I can
tell is very old</div>
		<div>the ghosts walk on</div>
		<div>That’s right!
I remember this
from the gas station!</div>
		<div>the sun came back!
The ghosts have
been released!</div>
		<div>I must have to
return the coins
to release the ghosts!</div>
		<div>Ah! This is it!</div>
		<div>Coins?
Could this be a token?</div>
		<div>ok… now the coins</div>
		<div>Oh!
This has to
go back to the school!</div>
		<div>I went back to the school
and unlocked a room I
remembered seeing from
earlier.</div>
		<div>these backpacks
must be keeping
the ghosts here</div>
		<div>That’s better!</div>
		<div>maybe I should
burn them</div>
		<div>Keys?
Is this a token?</div>
		<div>It’s got the same
writing on the walls as
earlier and the key worked
so this must be the
right place</div>
		<div>still not any better in
the dark...</div>
		<div>I’ll have to take this there</div>
		<div>A picture?
Could this be a token?</div>
		<div>Right!
The photo I saw
in the basement had
a photo like this
one!</div>
		<div>whoo! That’s a relief!</div>
		<div>here goes nothing</div>
		<div>continue>></div>
		<div>here goes nothing...</div>
		<div>continue>></div>
		<div>Needless to say, Brendan
was a bit spooked from his
encounter, but we managed
to find a brighter
side despite the darkness</div>
		<div>we know better now to
stick with the living and
enjoy the harmony of well
travelled locations</div>
		<div>we decided to no longer
seek out thrills
for the sake of it</div>
		<div>We took in the sights
of the forgotten town
before we drove on
to make some new
memories</div>
		<div>yelp reviews, everyone… just saying</div>
		<div>Play Again</div>
		<div>We took in the sights
of the forgotten town
before we drove on
to make some new
memories elsewhere</div>
		<div>Play Again</div>
